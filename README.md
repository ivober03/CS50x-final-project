# Habit Traxker (CS50x Final Project)

## Description:

This is my final project for the CS50x 2023 course. The main objective of this web application is to provide an environment where users can track their habits. 

This web application aims to help users develop and maintain healthy habits by providing a user-friendly interface to manage their habits. Users can sign up for a new account, or if they already have one, they can log in to access their personalized dashboard. On the dashboard, users can easily add new habits they want to adopt or remove from their daily routine.

  6. **TODO list:**
      - Users will have a to-do list that shows the notes for the added habits and the time by which they must complete them. The application will allow users to create a               personalized list of habits and set specific times for completing each task.
      - Additionally, the to-do list will provide users with a clear overview of their daily schedule, making it easier to manage their time effectively and ensure they don't           miss any important task throughout the day.
  
  7. **Progress Modal:**
      - The progress modal provides users with a visual representation of their habit-tracking progress over time.
